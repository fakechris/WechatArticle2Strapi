# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Enhanced Article Extractor is a Chrome extension that extracts articles from web pages (especially WeChat articles) and saves them to Strapi CMS. The extension uses advanced content extraction powered by the Defuddle library (same engine as Obsidian Clipper) and features automatic image upload, anti-extension interference protection, and rich metadata extraction.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development build with file watching
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Clean build files
npm run clean

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code
  - `background.js` - Service worker for API calls and data processing
  - `popup.js` - Extension popup UI logic
  - `content-bundled.js` - Content script (bundled with Defuddle)
  - `options.js` - Settings page logic
- `dist/` - Built extension files (generated by webpack)
- `manifest.json` - Chrome extension manifest
- `webpack.config.js` - Build configuration

## Architecture

The extension follows Chrome Extension Manifest V3 architecture:

1. **Content Script** (`content-bundled.js`) - Runs on web pages, extracts content using Defuddle engine
2. **Background Script** (`background.js`) - Handles Strapi API calls, image uploads, data processing
3. **Popup** (`popup.js`) - User interface for content preview and extraction
4. **Options** (`options.js`) - Configuration interface for Strapi connection settings

## Key Technical Details

### Content Extraction Engine
- Uses Defuddle library (same as Obsidian Clipper) for high-quality content extraction
- Fallback to WeChat-specific selectors for compatibility
- Anti-extension interference system to prevent other extensions from polluting extracted content

### Image Processing
- Automatic head image upload to Strapi media library
- Smart image filtering and relevance detection
- Base64 encoding for cross-domain image access

### Strapi Integration
- REST API integration with configurable endpoints
- Automatic slug generation using the `slug` library
- Field mapping system for flexible Strapi schema support

### Build System
- Webpack 5 for bundling Node.js modules for browser environment
- Fallback configurations for Node.js modules (path, fs, crypto, etc.)
- Copy plugin for static assets and manifest transformation

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to source files in `src/`
2. Run `npm run dev` for development with file watching
3. Load unpacked extension from `dist/` folder in Chrome
4. Use `npm run build` for production builds

## Important Files to Understand

- `src/background.js:5-28` - Image upload functionality
- `src/background.js:30-50` - Content sanitization and extension UI removal
- `webpack.config.js:16-27` - Node.js module fallbacks for browser environment
- `manifest.json:24-31` - Content script configuration for early DOM injection

## Testing

Load the extension in Chrome via `chrome://extensions/` with Developer Mode enabled, then test on WeChat articles or other web pages. No automated test suite is currently configured.
